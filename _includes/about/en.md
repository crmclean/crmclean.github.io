Hi, I am Craig McLean. I am a bioinformatician working to stop harmful algal blooms. I am a graduate student in the [Environmental Environmental Science Group](https://www2.whoi.edu/site/molecular-environmental-science/) through the [MIT-WHOI joint program](https://mit.whoi.edu/). Most of my work centers around thinking about metabolism, the range of biochemical reactions within a cell. I'm broadly interested in software development, ecology, music, and art. 

Prior to grad school, I studied chemistry and math at the University of Arkansas. I did lots of internships there, from developing tobacco exposure biomarkers and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/secondhand_smoke/index.htm) to motivating bacterial cultures to produce ample amounts of natural products at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/). 

##### Goals For This Page 

One thing I lack right now is the ability to write really well. I mean really really well. I think clear and concise communication is an invaluable skill independent of trade. So, hopefully this blog will give me the opportunity to practice, and maybe if I'm lucky, get some feedback. 

Hopefully some of the content within this page can be useful to you, the reader. I'll try to make some posts describing anything papers and ideas from my field and some more personal ones talking about a book or an album I really connected with. More to come! 

##### Projects and Memorable Experiences 

I firmly believe that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" - Aristotle. In this section, I'll highlight some projects and experiences I have shared with others in grad school.
